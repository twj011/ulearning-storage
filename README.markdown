## How It Works

```
User → Vercel Frontend → Vercel Functions API → Ulearning API → Huawei Cloud OBS
```

1. **Login**: Obtains an access token via the Ulearning API.
2. **Upload**: Uses the token to call the Ulearning OBS upload interface.
3. **Storage**: Files are stored directly in Huawei Cloud OBS.
4. **Access**: Files are accessed via links provided by Ulearning.

## Development

### Local Setup
```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env  # Configure your Ulearning credentials
npm run dev           # Start the development server
```
